# Palette


Palette is a new API for Android that allows you to extract and make use of colors in an image. It also has a support library in order for older versions of Android to make use of Palette.

Google has made theming based on the colors in an image incredibly easy. All you need is an image bitmap and the Palette library, and youâ€™re good to go. Google wants Android apps to have more colors in order to follow the Material Design guidelines, and Palette provides developers with a way to grab colors that will work well with images in our apps.
